# Diagram-IV

"Diagram IV" is a generative fashion and computational embroidery project inspired by Ada Lovelace's notes on Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine. This wearable artifactâ€”a graduation dress constructed from tulle and 3D printed beadworkâ€”transcribes segments of Lovelace's text into physical form using a custom Python preprocessing pipeline and OpenSCAD-generated paths.

The design references Diagram IV from Lovelace's historic publication in Scientific Memoirs, reinterpreted through the lens of code, fabrication, and femme identity. Bead placements are mapped from a bitmap of handwritten excerpts, tracing the legacy of early computing across a contemporary silhouette. The final garment is a tribute to computation, translation, and the poetic logic of algorithmic expression.

ðŸ§µ Technologies used: Python, OpenSCAD, 3D printing on textile

ðŸŽ“ Built for my graduation from the University of Rochester with a B.S. in Computer Science and minors in Mathematics, Gender Studies, and Spanish.

ðŸ‘— Dress inspiration: Robert Wun, SS24 runway collection
